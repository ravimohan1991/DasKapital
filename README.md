A brief note on the nature of Economics and role of Society in its context.
(Both are quite unknown to me at this time)

What does it mean to be Human? Does having a healthy body, freedom of speech, concerete jungle, technological advances driven by power hunger and egoistic satisfaction really imply Human nature?

In this quest we seek to find out a definition of being Human and the relation to Nature.  We will be confronted by several existential factors and opposed by incomplete arguments (in very concerete forms) but we will proceed by having one Human sentiment, "Faith" and leverage life itself to test the sentiment by uncovering the dynamics of Human and Nature, together.
