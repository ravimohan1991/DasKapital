\section{Definitions}
This section consists of abstractions which will be summoned in the rest of the material.  Please try to be as cooperative as possible with them.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{Society} is a form? consisting of collective \emph{conciousness} of \emph{entities} or \emph{individuals} along with the mecanisms of sustenance for \emph{human} life form.  
  \end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  In \emph{Capitalist} mode of production in a \emph{Society}, the wealth is immense accumulation of commodities.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:commodity}
  A \emph{commodity} is an abstraction represented by an \emph{object} such that it
  \begin{itemize}
  \item is outside \emph{human} context
  \item results in human satisfaction
  \item represents collection of \emph{some}\footnote{The nature of some will be revealed elsewhere within these notes.} properties
  \end{itemize} 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{utility} of a commodity is the resultant of physical properties of that commodity.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
 \label{def:thing}
  A \emph{thing} is certain form of commodity?  Examples are silicon chip, figurine, and energy drinks.
\end{definition}
Note: every useful thing has two point of views: \emph{qualitative} and \emph{quantitative}.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:usevalue}
  The utility of a thing\footnote{The ``thing'' could be ``product of human labor''} makes the thing a \emph{use value}.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{lemma}
    Commodity is a use value.
    \end{lemma}
  \begin{proof}
    From definitions \ref{def:thing} and \ref{def:usevalue} it is easy to see that once we use the qualitative(?) viewpoint, commodity is essentially a use value.
  \end{proof}
  \begin{remark}
    We note that use value is now a property of the commodity defined in definition \ref{def:commodity}.  Further more we demand/observe that the use value
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (\textcolor{blue}{Schezophrenia Alert!!!}) is \textbf{completely} independent of the amount of \textcolor{red}{labor}(needs clarification on the definition here) spent into the commodity to appropriate its properties.  Not really sure if Karl is referring to use value or the virtue that utility of commodity manifests itself as use value that is independent of the labor.
    \item  is associated with \emph{definite} quantities for instance couple of transistors, six-pack of monster drink, and dozen of static meshes.
    \item is for gauging the commercial knowledge associated with the commodity.
    \item becomes reality \emph{only} on consumption.
      \item constitute the substance of all wealth (irrespective of the social form of the wealth).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}

  \begin{definition}
    \label{def:exchval}
    \emph{Exchange value} is a quantitative relation which relates the value of one sort to that of other.\footnote{Here we have defined exchange value in very generic form.  No reference to previous terminologies is supposed to be invoked.}  The relation constantly changes with \emph{time} and \emph{place}.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{remark}
    We note that
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Exchange value \emph{appears} to be something accidental.
    \item Purely \emph{relative}.
    \item One sort can have different exchange values depending on what other sorts it is being compared with.
    \item A \emph{natural} step would be to assume exchange values be transitive.
      \item I suspect that the existence of multiple commodities in the same context gives rise to notion of exchange vlaues.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{remark}

    \begin{lemma}
      Exchange value is intrinsic to the commodities.\footnote{It seems in direct contradiction with the statement ``Nothing can have intrinsik value'' \cite{Barbon:777}.}
    \end{lemma}

    \begin{proof}
      It is quite easy to see that.
      \end{proof}

      \begin{remark}
        We note that
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Exchange values arise in the quantitative viewpoint of commodities.
          \item Exchange values are completely independent from use values.
          \end{itemize}
        \end{remark}

        \begin{definition}
          \emph{Human labor} is an abstract property of commodity which is devoid of any qualitative substance\footnote{Getting rid of use values of the product in this context.  Or is he?  Later he writes that ``Values are abstractedf from use values''.  Is this acceptable?} and useful character of any definite kind of labor (like that of mason, porter, and builder) along with their concerete form, and which is common to all the commodities viewed as \emph{product of labor}.
        \end{definition}

        \begin{remark}
        We note that
        \begin{itemize}
        \item the definition is independent of whatever change of hands the commodity goes through.
        \item the defintion is concerned with the commodity as product of labor by virtue of the commodity's essence and not any qualitative viewpoint.
        \item human labor is \emph{homogeneous} with respect to the commodity.
        \end{itemize}
      \end{remark}

      \begin{definition}
        \emph{Values} are mere congelation (semi-solidification) of homogeneous human labor and \emph{labor power}\footnote{The labor power is the \emph{reservior} of the human labor.} expended irrespective of \emph{mode} of its expenditure.
      \end{definition}

      \begin{remark}
        We note that
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Karl fished out this definition of Values by some ``Social Substance crystal''.  I need to understand what it exactly is.
          \item At this point he kind of stresses that Values are abstracted from use values?
        \end{itemize}
      \end{remark}

      \begin{lemma}
        Values of commodities are expressed/manifest themselves in form of exchange values when commodities are exchanged.
      \end{lemma}

      \begin{proof}
        From definition \ref{def:exchval} (of exchange value) we demand that they be transitive.  As the consequence, when commodities (with of course different exchange values) are exchanged, they would still have a common substance, which we can \emph{naturally} identify as Value. 
      \end{proof}

      \begin{remark}
        We make the folowing statements
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The magnitude of value can be measured by the homogeneous human labor spent on the commodity, which, in turn, is measured by its duration.
        \item The duration can be ``denominated'' by weeks, days, and hours.
          \item Finally, we think and ponder on how to find physical representation of true homogeneous human labor.\footnote{Clearly a procrastinating worker completing the work in indefinite amount of time doesn't enhance the value of commodity.  If anything, it diminishes the value.}  
          \end{itemize} 
        \end{remark}

        \begin{definition}
          The total \emph{labor-power} of a society is the \emph{sum total} of the values of \emph{all} the commodities produced by the same society.  This is the homogenoeus mass of uniform human labor-power.
        \end{definition}

        \begin{remark}
          We note that
          \begin{itemize}
          \item Labor-power is \emph{thought to be} composed of innumerable individual \emph{units}\footnote{\textcolor{red}{The detailed analysis on \emph{unit} should be revealed in the later part of these notes.}}.
            \item Futhermore we assume that these units are indistinguisahble from each other.  Each representative of \emph{some} average colletive property (of society).
            \item Units instrument the gauging of social standards.  That is, what are the regular working timings and so on.
          \end{itemize}
        \end{remark}
        
        Above discussion begs and then demands the right context for homogeneous human labor representation.  One individual may or maynot be enough, but from experience and Karl's arguments, it \emph{seems}, the right context arises with the \emph{collective contribution} of entities existing in a society.

        Let me explain and elaborate Karl's arguments for generating greater mass appeal!  The substance that generates the value (of commodity) is the uniform expenditure of a unit uniform labor-power in form of homogeneous human labor.
