\section{Definitions}
This section consists of abstractions which will be summoned in the rest of the material.  Please try to be as cooperative as possible with them.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{Society} is a form? consisting of collective \emph{conciousness} of \emph{entities} or \emph{individuals} along with the mecanisms of sustainance for \emph{human} life form.  
  \end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  In \emph{Capitalist} mode of production in a \emph{Society}, the wealth is immense accumulation of commodities.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:commodity}
  A \emph{commodity} is an abstraction represented by an \emph{object} such that it
  \begin{itemize}
  \item is outside \emph{human} context
  \item results in human satisfaction
  \item represents collection of \emph{some}\footnote{The nature of some will be revealed elsewhere within these notes.} properties
  \end{itemize} 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{utility} of a commodity is the resultant of physical properties of that commodity.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
 \label{def:thing}
  A \emph{thing} is certain form of commodity?  Examples are silicon chip, figurine, and energy drinks.
\end{definition}
Note: every useful thing has two point of views: \emph{qualitative} and \emph{quantitative}.

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:usevalue}
  The utility of a thing makes the thing a \emph{use value}.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{lemma}
    From definitions \ref{def:thing} and \ref{def:usevalue} it is easy to see that once we use the qualitative(?) viewpoint, commodity is essentially a use value.
  \end{lemma}
  \begin{remark}
    We note that use value is now a property of the commodity defined in definition \ref{def:commodity}.  Further more we demand/observe that the use value
    \begin{itemize}
    \item is \textbf{completely} independend of the amount of labor spent into the commodity.
    \item  is associated with \emph{definite} quantities for instance couple of transistors, six-pack of monster drink, and dozen of static meshes.
    \item is for gauging the commercial knowledge associated with the commodity.
    \item becomes reality \emph{only} on consumption.
      \item constitute the substance of all wealth (irrespective of the social form of the wealth).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}

  \begin{definition}
    \emph{Exchange value} is a quantitative relation of use values?
    \end{definition}
